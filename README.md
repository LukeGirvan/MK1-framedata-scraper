# MK1-framedata-scraper
This is my portion of a collaboration project with Zack Schenck to make a twitch bot that can tell you every frame of each character in the game mortal kombat 1.
My role was to scrape the data from mk1 akademy clean it and return it in JSON format so that zack could create a lookup for the bot to respond to input in the form of a command such as !{charname}-{button}-{ob-oh-su-ofb}
